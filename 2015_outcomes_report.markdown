The [Turing School of Software & Design](http://turing.io) is a 501(c)3 non-profit school located in Denver, Colorado. Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. We believe in a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it.

## 2015 Programs

Turing began in June 2014. We launched with just one course of study: "Web Application Development with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript." Our students are grouped into cohorts and the course divided into four six-week "modules" each separated by an intermission week. We begin a new cohort every seven weeks and, after the initial rampup months, run four cohorts simultaneously. The typical student is at Turing for a total of 27 weeks and our total student body numbers about 90 when classes are in session.

### Why Report Data

In March of 2015 we joined with a collective of other training providers to form the [New Economy Skills Training Association (NESTA)](http://thenesta.org/). That organization put together a [list of outcomes data points that member organizations would publish](https://www.dropbox.com/s/76zqbjy4ky8z29f/NESTA%20Letter%20to%20the%20POTUS.pdf?dl=0) in the future.

Beyond NESTA, Turing has a culture of transparency. You can find every one of our [lesson plans](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans), [tutorials](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source), and even a [few hundred class videos](https://vimeo.com/turing) all published online free for non-commercial use. It only makes sense, then, to be just as transparent with our student outcomes.

This is the **2015 Outcomes Report for Turing**. The following data represents the 1406, 1407, 1409, 1410, 1412, 1502, 1503, and 1505 cohorts of the Turing School, who graduated between December 2014 and December 2015.

### Outcome of Third-Party Audit

[Skills Fund](http://skills.fund/) is a leading financial partner for training programs like ours and is helping lead the charge to better define, understand, and share program outcomes. Joseph Kozusko, co-founder, volunteered to audit our data. Here is his statement:

      June 1, 2016

      Turing School of Software and Design asked Skills Fund to examine the 2015 Outcomes Report in order to provide transparency and third-party objectivity in reporting, tracking, and analyzing outcomes. 
      
      The examination was performed on the data provided, and included a review of individual and aggregate student records through statistical analysis and, on a test-sample basis, evidence supporting the outcomes from employers.  We believe that this examination provides a logical basis for the findings that:
      
      * the data types collected are relevant, fair, and consistent with industry best practices
      * the data analysis was performed with accurate and clean mathematical formulas
      * individual student records are robust and have a small (non-significant) percentage of missing information
      * outcomes-specific data related to employment status is, on a test-sample basis, accurate
      
      The conclusion of Skills Fund is that the Turing School of Software and Design 2015 Outcomes Report is reflective of strong data integrity, uses consistent standards measures, and indicates markers of a high-quality accelerated learning program.

## Completion Rates

* Total students who could have graduated: 136
* Number of students who are still enrolled: 4 (due to repeated modules / breaks)
* Number of students no longer enrolled: 136 - 4 = 132
* Number of graduates (strict): 101 (76.5%)
* Number of satisfactory outcomes: 110 (83.3%) *(represents number of graduates + persons employed before graduation)*

### Academic Success

Each of our four modules is pass/fail. How did graduates do? Among 94 respondents:

* Graduated with no repeats: 86 (91.5%)
* Graduated after repeating one module: 4 (4.3%)
* Graduated after repeating more than one module: 4 (4.3%)

### Non-Graduates

Why did people not graduate? Of the 29 non-graduates:

* Left before graduation due to employment: 9 (31.0% of non-grads, 6.8% of students)
* Academic drop out: 14 (48.2% of non-grads, 10.6% of students)
* Early drop / bad fit: 4 (13.8% of non-grads, 3.0% of students)
* Elective drop out: 2 (6.9% of non-grads, 1.5% of students)

Here's what those categories mean:

* *Left before graduation due to employment*: students start job hunting between 3rd and 4th quarters. If their job hunt is immediately successful then they'll sometimes leave before fourth quarter ends or go into "audit" mode. Either way they didn't officially graduate. This is not considered a problem.
* *Academic drop out*: the biggest bucket is students who left under academic distress. This unfortunately lumps together both students who were not academically successful based on their own aptitude/work and students who had outside circumstances (health, family, finances) impact their learning. Turing is a demanding program and this category should be the main reason people leave. In 2016 I believe we'll see this trend down towards 6-8% of enrollments.
* *Early drop / bad fit*: A small number of students arrive at Turing and drop out within three weeks, often in the first week. Of the four, three expressed that the workload was too heavy and one expressed that there was too little instruction. This is a category that we can work to eliminate.
* *Elective drop out*: Students who chose to leave while academically successful. One left to begin an MBA program, one left to begin a job hunt/contracting.

### Demographic Disaggregation

Each category is broken down by total students and graduates

* women: 38 enrolled (27.9% of enrollees), 27 graduated (26.7% of graduates)
* non-white: 32 enrolled (23.5% of enrollees), 28 graduated (27.7% of graduates)
* military veterans: 6 enrolled (4.4% of enrollees), 4 graduated (4.2% of graduates)
* students without a 4-year degree: 22 enrolled (20.9% of enrollees), 19 graduated (20.4% of graduates)

The most interesting thing to note here is that none of these groups show a negative correlation between membership in the group and likelihood of graduating. The only implications that stands out is that people of color appear more likely to graduate than their peers.

### Job Placement

"Job Placement" is the most complicated category to accurately measure. For this section we'll consider just the 101 students who graduated in the time period.

#### Non-Job-Seeking / Exemptions

Anomalies in the process can cause anomalies in the salary and job-hunt-length data. The following graduates have been exempted/removed from the aggregations:

* 1 student left the country for personal reasons (still found a job)
* 1 student is exempt due to lack of a US work visa (still found a job)
* 1 student is exempt due to a criminal record (still found a job)
* 1 student temporarily abandoned their job hunt (currently job hunting)
* 2 students had tuition refunded after prolonged job hunts (one now employed as a developer, one has an apprenticeship)

Therefore 95 students are tracked below.

#### Job Hunt Length

* signed before graduation: 23 (24.2%)
* full-time employment within 30 days: 46 (48.4%)
* full-time employment within 60 days: 61 (64.2%)
* full-time employment within 90 days: 80 (84.2%)
* full-time employment in 90+ days: 94 (95.8%)
* under 90 days without an offer: 2 (2.1%)
* over 90 days without an offer: 2 (2.1%)

In addition, 9 students signed a job offer before graduation but did not graduate (and are thus not reflected above). If counted in both the available pool (95+9 = 104) and in the pre-grad jobs, the numbers become:

* signed before graduation: 32 (30.77%)
* full-time employment within 30 days: 55 (52.9%)
* full-time employment within 60 days: 70 (67.3%)
* full-time employment within 90 days: 89 (85.6%)
* full-time employment in 90+ days: 109 (96.15%)
* currently under 90 days without an offer: 2 (1.9%)
* currently over 90 days without an offer: 2 (1.9%)

We regret not having a range of 90-120 days in the original student survey. Of the 20 students in the 90+ category, the vast majority were in the 90-120 range and a good chunk of those were not job hunting the entire time (vacations, weddings, etc).

#### Job Type

##### Reported Job Titles

Job titles in the industry are a mess. Here are the 86 job titles reported by employed alumni:

```
["assistant instructor", "assistant instructor", "assistant instructor", "associate engineer", "associate software engineer", "associate software engineer", "developer", "developer", "developer", "developer", "developer", "developer", "developer", "developer", "devops engineer", "devops engineer", "front-end engineer", "frontend engineer", "frontend software developer", "full stack developer", "full stack software developer", "jr. full stack developer", "junior application developer", "junior dev (web and mobile)", "junior developer", "junior developer", "junior developer", "junior rails developer", "junior rubyist", "junior software developer", "junior software developer", "junior software developer", "junior software developer", "junior software engineer", "partner", "product developer", "qa engineer", "qa engineer", "qa engineer", "research associate", "resident apprentice", "senior agile developer", "site content engineer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer", "software developer ii", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer", "software engineer/senior architect", "solution developer", "teaching assistant ", "team lead/full-stack developer", "web developer", "web developer"]
```

* total non-exempt graduates: 95
* full-time developers: 77
* in time-limited apprenticeships: 1
* quality assurance: 3
* contractors/self-employed: 1
* total of technical roles: 82
* employed by Turing: 4
* unemployed: 4
* non-reporting: 5

Of the four students employed by Turing, two are permanent long-term staff and two are in temporary roles while they wait for work visas. All four are responsible for technical instruction and are among the finest developers we've graduated.

Of the five employed alumni who did not report job titles, four are known to be in full-time technical roles (1 devops, 3 developers).

#### Salary

* average salary of employed graduates: $74,447
* average increase of yearly salary compared with previous job: $33,195

In addition, we looked at the salary increase for persons who previously earned less than $60,000/year before attending Turing. There are 64 of those employed graduates and their average salary delta is $44,729.

### Tuition

Our standard Tuition is $17,500. Students who have a recent Macbook Pro can decline the included laptop and pay a reduced tuition of $16,300. Some students get an additional discount based on their referral pipeline or a diversity scholarship.

All together the average tuition paid by graduates is $16,800.

#### The Real Cost of Turing

We encourage students to calculate the real cost of Turing. For those persons earning under $60,000, the average previous salary is conservatively (high) $45,000. The average job hunt lasts about 2 months. A single person can get by on about $1500/month in Denver. The real cost of Turing is thus:

* Tuition: $17,500
* 9-months of not working: 45000 * 9/12 = $33750
* 9-months of cost-of-living: 1500 * 9 = $13,500
* *Real Cost* = 17500 + 33750 + 13500 = $64,750

Then what is the timeline to payoff that investment? With an average salary delta of $44,729, those students pay off their investment in 17 months.

*"Isn't that double-counting cost-of-living?"* people have asked? Here's how we're thinking about it: imagine that Turing is a terrible program. After the 27 weeks of class and two months of job hunting you end up right back in your same old job at the same old salary. In that scenario, what would you have lost? That's why the cost-of-living is counted above and the total is $64,750.

## Conclusions

Overall, for an institution that's less than two years old, we are satisfied with the results. Some of our key takeaways and intentions for the future are:

### Diversity

**We must attract, enroll, and graduate more women, people of color, and veterans.**

This year we'll build up stronger partnerships with old friends like [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) and [Teach for America](https://www.teachforamerica.org/). We'll begin new ones with organizations like [City Year](http://www.cityyear.org/) and [Denver Community College](https://www.ccd.edu/). In the summer of 2016 we anticipate approval from the VA to accept Post-9/11 GI Bill funding and thus open the door more widely to our veterans and their spouses/dependents. We'll also add at least two roles to our operations team and put more purposeful marketing and recruiting systems in place to ensure we're building a sustainable pipeline.

### Graduation Rate

**We must graduate a higher percentage of students without any sacrifice in academic rigor.**

Even mixing in those who leave early due to employment, we're looking a graduation rate in the 80s. [MIT hovers in the area of 91-93%](http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/students/graduation_rates.html). [Stanford boasts a 94% graduation rate](http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/stanford-university/academic-life/graduation-and-retention/#). We can do better.

So far in late 2015 / early 2016 we have put in place the following changes:

* The "Echo"/"Foxtrot" split for the first three weeks of Module 1, [inspired by Harvey Mudd](http://qz.com/192071/how-one-college-went-from-10-female-computer-science-majors-to-40/)
* Creation of a *Student Support Fellowship*, a six-week fellowship for a recent grad where they spend 24 hours per week pairing with our most struggling students
* Revising our prework content to be more focused, have higher expectations, and be more easily monitored. We've also added volunteer "prework guides" (current and past students) who give one-on-one support to students before they arrive
* Foster the growth of student interest/support groups like the Joan Clarke Society (for female students), LGBTuring, and newly the Turing Asian American Programmers. Our experience shows a clear correlation between a student's success/happiness and their depth of connection to the student community around them.
* Revising admissions process to focus more clearly on the Turing mindset: growth, engagement, agency, empathy, and grit.
* Increase the number of financial lending partners and diversify their offerings, including some who can now lend students funds for their cost-of-living while in the program (lightening stress/dependency on savings/other people)
* Creation of a Community Affairs Manager role who is now able to keep a pulse on students, steer their growth, and catch warning signs more quickly

With these efforts in place we seek to nearly eliminate the "Early Drop / Bad Fit" category (currently 3%) and reduce the "Academic Drop Out" (currently 10%) so combined they are the outcome for less than 8% of enrollees in 2016.

### Employment Pipelines

**We must help students secure high-satisfaction jobs more quickly.**

Though almost all graduates find jobs they're excited about, the process is entirely too stressful for everyone involved. 60% of students accepted their first job offer. We want students to be choosing between three to five job offers, selecting the one that best aligns with their personal goals. In addition, this is our [Apollo Moon Challenge](http://history.nasa.gov/moondec.html):

**Every graduate of Turing will have a signed employment contract the day they graduate.**

To do that we will:

* Build up our employment team (email jeff@turing.io if you'd like more information!)
* Build up our data management tools and processes around the job hunt
* Better track our alumni and harvest their job hunt information
* Form sustainable partnerships with outside hiring companies, especially those who can hire X students every Y modules
* Coordinate with economic development organizations, both within the government and outside it
* Increase our reach beyond our personal networks through events, writing, sharing, speaking, public relations, and supporting the people and efforts around us
* Leverage our long-time alumni as they begin to look for their second jobs, using them to open doors for current grads
* Create a supported apprenticeship program where experienced developers on our staff assist grads in ramping up at their new jobs, thus lowering the risk for employers

Through those efforts we expect to see over 80% of graduates employed within 30 days of graduation in 2016 and reach the moon challenge in 2017.

## Data & Methodology

### Where did the data come from?

* Graduation data was pulled from our internal records
* Employment outcomes were reported by students in a survey conducted in February 2016

### Was the data modified?

Yes. The data was modified/sanitized in the following ways:

* Many salary numbers were expanded from abbreviations (like `68k` to `68000`)
* Salaries stated in an hourly rate (mostly from pre-Turing jobs) were extrapolated to a similar annual salary
* A few anomalies were simplified such as a job title of `some corporate BS` became `developer` when I knew the details of their job
* Non-graduates and exempted job hunters were at times excluded as described in the relevant sections above

### Is this the *real* story?

We don't believe in hiding skeletons in the closet. Many of our numbers are below what other programs will claim. We work hard on recruiting and selecting a diverse, capable group of students. We cram as much learning as possible into their seven months. Then we help them find great jobs and launch fantastic careers. We iterate on those processes constantly, do the best we can, and these are the results. Whatever the data says we're ok with it.

If you'd like to hear it straight from the students, [read reviews on CourseReport](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/turing#/reviews).

### Raw Data

The data used in this study along with the calculation results can be found here:

* [CSV Data](data/2015_turing_outcomes_data.csv)
* [Spreadsheet PDF](data/2015_turing_outcomes_data.pdf)

I regret that limitations of Google Spreadsheets prevent us from easily sharing the one public-ready sheet without exposing the sheets with private information. Hopefully these files can be useful to the curious.

Note that data about tuition/payment plans is omitted from the data set as there was no way to keep it meaningful but hide the privacy of our lending partners, scholarship/referral partners, etc.

### Changes, Errors, Corrections, and Questions

As new data comes in from students, errors are found in the calculations, or other data questions arise this report may be edited and updated. Questions or corrections can be sent to contact@turing.io

#### Known Issues / Pending Changes

* There's still debate about how to calculate the "real cost of Turing" but all other opinions lead to a lower total cost -- so what we have here is the most safely pessimistic
* There are four students still enrolled, they were properly exempted from job hunt timelines, but they should have been omitted from the denominator in the calculation of graduation rates which should increase rates about 2%
* Since the data was compiled and the report published, a few additional students have supplied their outcomes data. Each of them has favorable data that should marginally increase the average salary and decrease the time-to-employment.
